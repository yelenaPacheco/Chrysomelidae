## This repository includes scripts used to generate a worldwide phylogeny of Chrysomelidae. 
### There are X steps in this pipeline 
1. Obtain raw read sequences (libraries) from Genbank using srr accession numbers  
   See [sra_tookit.md](https://github.com/yelenaPacheco/Chrysomelidae/blob/main/sra_toolkit.md)
3. Trim adaptor sequences from reads  
  See [fastp.md](fastp.md)
5. Assemble reads and get sequence contigs
6. Tree assembly
